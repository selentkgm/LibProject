the twist
smooth
mack the knife
uptown funk!
how do i live
party rock anthem
i gotta feeling
macarena (bayside boys mix)
shape of you
physical
you light up my life
hey jude
closer
we belong together
un-break my heart
yeah!
bette davis eyes
endless love
tonight’s the night (gonna be alright)
you were meant for me/foolish games
(everything i do) i do it for you
i’ll make love to you
the theme from “a summer place”
le freak
how deep is your love
eye of the tiger
we found love
low
just want to be your everything
every breath you take
somebody that i used to know
despacito
flashdance… what a feeling
rolling in the deep
tossin’ and turnin’
the battle of new orleans
one sweet day
truly madly deeply
silly love songs
let’s get it on
night fever
another one bites the dust
say say say
how you remind me
tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree
it’s all in the game
i want to hold your hand
shadow dancing
call me maybe
